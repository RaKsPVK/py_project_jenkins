A sample Python project
=======================

A sample project that exists as an aid to the `Python Packaging User Guide
Tutorial
<https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html>`_.

This project aims to cover core packaging features and does *not* aim to
cover project "best practices."  In particular, it deliberately refrains
from making recommendations on third-party tools or services such as
for documentation, automated testing, continuous integration, etc.
