# Sample project

A sample project that exists as an aid to the Python Packaging User Guide's Tutorial
 on Packaging and Distributing Projects.

This project does not aim to cover best practices for Python project development
 as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool recommendations
 for version control, documentation, or testing.

Most of the configuration for a Python project is done in the setup.py file,
 an example of which is included in this project. You should edit this file
 accordingly to adapt this sample project to your needs.
